# Identity V Database
This project develops a player profile and game character database for Identity V, an asymmetrical survival horror game. It tracks **players**, their **server**, and **character cards**, which unlock **characters** (_survivors_ and _hunters_). The database also includes **guilds**, **teams**, and **talents** that enhance character abilities. 

To drop, recreate, and reload tables, run all.sql.

To run the application locally, cd into this repo and run sh ./remote-start.sh. Then open local host with the port number provided in the terminal.
